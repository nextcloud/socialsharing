WhatsApp brand assets and guidelines
February 2025

Introduction

As a condition to using the WhatsApp brand assets ("WhatsApp Brand Resources"), you agree to all the guidelines and instructions below ("Guidelines").

These Guidelines clarify the ways you can and cannot use the WhatsApp Brand Resources for marketing and other purposes. These Guidelines also contain legal disclosures and a general set of questions and answers that address common inquiries and concerns.


General guidelines

Use the WhatsApp name and logos found on our WhatsApp Brand Guidelines website only, and not those found anywhere else. Make sure you check the WhatsApp Brand Resources in these Guidelines often to ensure you're using the most current version.

Do not use other trademarks, names, domain names, logos, or other content that could be confused with WhatsApp.

When you're talking about WhatsApp, always capitalize the letters "W" and "A," and never modify or abbreviate the word "WhatsApp."

Remember to display the word WhatsApp in the same font size and style as the content surrounding it, and never use any of the WhatsApp logos to replace the word WhatsApp in a sentence.


Legal
